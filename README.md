## 1. Introduction  
Air traffic is a critical component of national and international transportation infrastructure. This project explores U.S. international air traffic trends by analyzing scheduled flight volumes, airport activity, airline carrier performance, and passenger movement over time. It leverages historical and categorical data to understand travel patterns and identify the busiest airports and carriers.

## 2. Objective  
The objective of this analysis is to provide insights into U.S. international air traffic patterns by examining flight volumes, peak travel periods, top-performing airports, and airline carriers. The goal is to help stakeholders in transportation, policy and logistics make informed decisions based on real data.

## 3. Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of international departure records from U.S. airports, categorized by month, airport, year, airline carrier and passenger type. It includes both scheduled and charter flights, allowing for comparison of traffic patterns and peak loads.

### Key Variables:
- Airport Codes (Domestic and Foreign)  
- Flight Type (Scheduled or Charter)  
- Month and Year  
- Airline Carriers  
- Passenger Counts  

## 4. Methodology  
The dashboard was created through the following steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Grouping flight records by year, month and airport  
3. Calculating the number of scheduled vs chartered flights  
4. Ranking top airports and airline carriers by volume  
5. Visualizing trends over time  

## 5. Research Questions  
- What are the busiest U.S. airports for international departures?  
- Which foreign airports receive the most U.S. international traffic?  
- Which airline carriers operate the most scheduled international flights?  
- What are the monthly and yearly trends in scheduled flights?  
- How does charter traffic compare to scheduled flights?

## 6. Process  
- Loaded the air traffic dataset into a data visualization tool  
- Aggregated data by airport and flight type  
- Sorted and filtered top 10 entries for both domestic and foreign airports  
- Charted year-over-year trends and monthly activity  
- Compared scheduled vs charter passenger volumes  

## 7. Insights  
- Miami (MIA) is the busiest U.S. airport for international departures  
- Toronto Pearson (YYZ) is the top foreign airport by U.S. departure volume  
- UA and DL are the most active airline carriers for scheduled international flights  
- Flight volumes peak in July and decline in February  
- Scheduled flights significantly outnumber chartered flights  

## 8. Key Findings  
- Scheduled flights show steady growth from 1990 to 2019 before dropping sharply in 2020  
- Summer months (July and August) consistently see the highest number of scheduled flights  
- Charter flights account for a very small portion of total international passengers  
- The busiest foreign airports are mostly located in Canada and Europe  
- Airline carriers US, UA and DL lead in the number of scheduled international flights  

## 9. Conclusion  
The U.S. international air traffic data reveals strong seasonal patterns and long-term growth in scheduled flights. Major airports such as MIA and ATL dominate outbound traffic, while international hubs like YYZ and LHR receive significant inbound volumes. Scheduled air travel vastly exceeds chartered services in both frequency and passenger count. The drop in 2020 highlights the impact of global disruptions on air travel. These findings are useful for logistics planning, airline strategy, and infrastructure development.
